The SDK handles all the GraphQL translation internally—you don't need to know GraphQL.\n\n2. **Engine provisioning**: The client either connects to an existing Dagger Engine or automatically provisions a new one on-the-fly. The Engine runs as an OCI-compatible (Open Container Initiative) container and acts as the runtime for your pipeline.\n\n3. **Session creation**: Once connected, your client opens a session with the Engine.
